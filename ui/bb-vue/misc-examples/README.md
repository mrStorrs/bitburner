## asciichart window example

this example uses an ASCII chart library to push a standard array of values into a `<bb-win>` window component. it bundles
a nice monospace font called `FreeMono` which helps render these ASCII charts smoothly.

the graph will auto-pause when hovered over so you can scroll and inspect, and then resume & fast-forward to catch up
with any events that may have been buffered while paused.

## svgchart window example

this example shows how to create a DOM target within a `<bb-win>` component, and then inject raw DOM elements into it from
another script. specifically, a big ol' SVG chart that's built in `svgchart-builder.js`.

this doesn't so much show off the reactive nature of Vue's data binding, but instead shows how
various `bb-vue` UI can be setup to co-exist with other, more traditional DOM manipulation techniques.
